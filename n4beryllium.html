  <br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>Basic Information:</h2>
  <br>
    <ul>

     <li><b>Atomic Number:</b> 4</li>
     <li><b>Symbol:</b> Be</li>
     <li><b>Atomic Mass:</b> 9.012 g/mol</li>
     <li><b>Group:</b> 2 (Alkaline earth metals)</li>
     <li><b>Period:</b> 2</li>
    </ul>
  <br>

<h2>Electronic Configuration: 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup></h2>
  <br>

<h2>Position in the Periodic Table:</h2>
  <br>
    <ul>

     <li>Located in the second group (alkaline earth metals), known for their reactivity and metallic properties.</li>
     <li>Stands out due to its smaller size compared to other alkaline earth metals, leading to some unique characteristics.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>

<h2>Physical Properties:</h2>
<br> 
    <ul>
     	<li>Relatively light metal, about twice as dense as water</li>
     	<li>Steel-gray, strong, and brittle metal</li>
     	<li>High melting and boiling points (1287°C, 2469°C)</li>
     	<li>Good conductor of heat and electricity</li>
     	<li>Transparent to X-rays, making it valuable for X-ray windows and instruments</li>
   </ul>
<br>

<h2>Chemical Properties:</h2>
<br>
    <ul>

      <li>Moderately reactive due to its two valence electrons</li>
      <li>Forms mostly covalent bonds with other elements</li>
      <li>Reacts with oxygen to form beryllium oxide (BeO), a highly stable ceramic material</li>
      <li>Forms beryllium compounds with halogens, nitrogen, and carbon</li>
      <li>Beryllium dust and fumes are highly toxic and require careful handling</li>
    </ul>
<br>
